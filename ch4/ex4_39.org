* Exercise 4.39

Re-ordering would make no difference to the answer.

I think re-ordering would make a slight difference in the runtime, but it would
be a tiny difference.

This is hand-wavier than I'd like since I'm not enumerating all possibile paths
to calculate number of steps.

Update: After writing this I found
https://wqzhang.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/sicp-exercise-4-39/ which shows
ordering can have a bigger effect on runtime than I thought. That is a good
preliminary analysis of possibility space. I have to consider efficiency of the
tests and number of times the test is called.
